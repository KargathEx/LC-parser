# lc_debug
debug leetcode testcase in local

From [there](https://github.com/luckystone60/leetcode-helper)
with some modifications and deletions.

mainly to deal with ```forked repositories are not currently searchable. ``` problem, so I'm no fork from the original author.

todo: support simulation problems like [this](https://leetcode.com/problems/dinner-plate-stacks/)
